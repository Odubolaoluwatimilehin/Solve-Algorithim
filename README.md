# Solved-Algorithims-Exercise

This project contains a collection of algorithm and data structure questions I've been able to solve JavaScript.

My solution to coding exercise, codility lessons and algo questions.

Feel free to send a PR with modifications, corrections and ideas on how to improve on the time and space complexity.

Enjoy!!! :)
